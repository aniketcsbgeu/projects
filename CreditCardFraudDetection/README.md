PROJECT NAME :- Credit card fraud detection

ABSTRACT :- The objective is using machine learning model build a detection of fraud credit card transaction system.

PROCEDURE :- Firstly downloaded the credit card fraud detection dataset from kaggle.
             Analysed the no. of fraud cases and no. of valid transaction from give dataset.
             then, seperated the X and Y values, i.e, input parameters and output value format, 
             one for training the model and the other one for testing the model.
             final prediction had been done by Random forest classifier model and after evaluating the classifier we obtained
             the result and visualized the confusion matrix.
   
RESULT :-    RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER,

              Accuracy is 0.9995962220427653
