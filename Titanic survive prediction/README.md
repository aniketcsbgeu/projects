PROJECT NAME :- Passengers survived the titanic shipwreck

ABSTRACT :- This is a classification based prediction problem, THis project aims to get a better accuracy model
            that can predict  the no. of people survived, using machine learning model.
            
PROCEDURE :- Firstly the dataset had been taken from kaggle each for training ang testing the model.
             Model is being trained on the trainning dataset.
             Analysis of data from datset is done through various mapping and graph technique.
             Few machine learning model such as, KNeighborsClassifier,DecisionTreeClassifier,
             RandomForestClassifier,GaussianNB,SVC e.t.c,
             is imported for the classification based prediction and the accuracy value is determined.
             
RESULT:-              
             Score of Model 0 : 82.6
             Score of Model 1 : 79.58
             Score of Model 2 : 80.36
             Score of Model 3 : 78.78
             Score of Model 4 : 83.5
             Score of Model 5 : 79.92
             Score of Model 6 : 81.25
             Score of Model 7 : 81.03
             Score of Model 8 : 80.25
